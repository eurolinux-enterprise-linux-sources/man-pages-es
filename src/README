* DESCRIPTION

This package contains the translation into Spanish of the English
man-pages package. It is a beta release, so you can still find a lot
of bugs.  Contributions are welcome. For any doubt or suggestion about
this release, send an e-mail to Juan Piernas Canovas <piernas at
ditec.um.es>. In order to collaborate with the project, please visit
http://es.tldp.org.

An archive of the currently available man pages in Spanish can be
found at http://www.ditec.um.es/~piernas/manpages-es/

* INSTALLATION

"make install" will just copy Spanish man pages to
/usr/share/man/es/man[1-8], where the man application will find them
if you set LANG to es_ES or es_ES.UTF-8.

"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than the
already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed', then remove
old versions (compressed or not), and finally copy them to
/usr/share/man/es/man[1-8].

If your man pager can handle compressed source pages (man-1.5 can),
you might do "make gz" or "make bz2" before "make install", or just
say "make allgz" or "make allbz". Note that you may have to remove
preformatted pages.

Also note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages also
distributed in other packages. This has been reported about dlclose.3,
dlerror.3, dlopen.3, dlsym.3 (found in ld.so), about resolver.3,
resolv.conf.5 (found in bind-utils), and about passwd.5, and
mailaddr.7. Be careful not to overwrite more up-to-date versions.
Reports on further duplicates are welcome.  Formerly present and now
removed duplicates:

	 *_module.2, get_kernel_syms.2 (found in modutils-2.1.*),
         exports.5 (found in nfs-server-2.2*), fstab.5, nfs.5 (found
         in util-linux-2.11*), lilo.8, lilo.conf.5 (found in lilo-21.6*).

Note that the pages that come with GNU fileutils are really
help texts (indeed, are generated automatically from help texts),
and worse than worthless. Without them people would have good
detailed man pages, such as those found here in man1.
As it is, many distributions install these "man pages",
to the detriment of their users.

Send corrections and enhancements of this release Spanish man pages to
Juan Piernas <piernas at ditec.um.es> (man.7 has some info on the
macros to use). Send corrections of the English man pages to
aeb@cwi.nl.
